# This is an example ODI analysis using the simulated data generated via the mock_data_generator. 
# It analyses survey responses for 100 outcomes and generates a CSV file of results per outcome, as well as a PNG file with the opportunity map showing the outcomes color-coded based on the opportunity category they are in. 
# To adjust this code for other datasets, modify the 'import data' section based on your data structure. Depending on the exact format output by your survey tool, you may need to do extra work (e.g. convert strings to numbers, etc)
